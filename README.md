Private chats with commitment issues.



## What is this?

It’s a tiny chat room that:
- doesn’t ask who you are
- doesn’t remember what you said
- doesn’t get emotionally attached

You enter a room code, pick a name, talk…  
and then everything quietly disappears.

No sign-ups.  
No profiles.  
No “we’ll keep this forever”.



## Why would anyone want this?

Because not every conversation needs:
- an account
- a history
- a timeline
- a database entry that lives longer than you intended

Sometimes you just want to talk **now**, not archive it for later.

This is for those moments.



## How does it feel?

Like:
- writing on a foggy mirror
- passing notes that self-destruct
- having a hallway conversation that ends when you walk away

Nothing sticks around longer than it should.



## What makes it nice?

- **No identity baggage**  
  Be whoever you want, just for now.

- **Rooms that don’t overstay**  
  When a room is gone, it’s actually gone.

- **Messages that expire**  
  This place forgets on purpose.

- **No user profiles, ever**  
  You’re not being “built up” into anything.

Think of it as a chat app with a very short memory — by design.



## What this is *not*

Let’s get this out of the way:

- Not a social network  
- Not a messaging archive  
- Not a productivity workspace  
- Not a place to “build your online presence”  

If you want permanence, this will feel frustrating.  
**"That’s a feature!!!"**.



## Who is this for?

- Friends planning something quick  
- People sharing something sensitive  
- Teams needing a temporary channel  
- Anyone tired of accounts and digital footprints  

If your thought is:
> “I just need a place to talk — and then I’m done”

You’re in the right place.



## Things this project refuses to become

This will never:
- ask for your real name
- demand an account
- store conversations long-term
- optimize for engagement or growth
- pretend forgetting is a bug

If it ever does, something has gone wrong.



## Open, on purpose

Everything here is open to look at.

Not because it’s trendy but because privacy should be **inspectable**, not a promise you’re asked to trust.



## In short

Talk freely.  
Leave quietly.  
Nothing follows you out.

That’s it.
